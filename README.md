# FIRAT AR

This project is an example for a location based AR app with navigation support. 
Coordinates have aimed FÄ±rat University Faculty of Technology. Change it to where do you want...

I used just some angle formulas and plugins to calculate true directions with ios compass and maps.
I think its still not stable but nice example for better works

used: 

- arkit_plugin
- geolocator
- flutter_tts
- flutter_compass
- video_player(**optional** - after launchscreen I put a intro video)

First step

`flutter pub get`

After installed plugins, change your AR Resources on Xcode to scan your target image(s)

For trying different AR objects or geometries, you can look arkit_plugin docs
